/**
 * A handler for parser events. Instances of this class can be given to a {@link JsonParser}. The
 * parser will then call the methods of the given handler while reading the input.
 * <p>
 * The default implementations of these methods do nothing. Subclasses may override only those
 * methods they are interested in. They can use {@code getLocation()} to access the current
 * character position of the parser at any point. The {@code start*} methods will be called
 * while the location points to the first character of the parsed element. The {@code end*}
 * methods will be called while the location points to the character position that directly follows
 * the last character of the parsed element. Example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ["lorem ipsum"]
 *  ^            ^
 *  startString  endString
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Subclasses that build an object representation of the parsed JSON can return arbitrary handler
 * objects for JSON arrays and JSON objects in {@link #startArray()} and {@link #startObject()}.
 * These handler objects will then be provided in all subsequent parser events for this particular
 * array or object. They can be used to keep track the elements of a JSON array or object.
 * </p>
